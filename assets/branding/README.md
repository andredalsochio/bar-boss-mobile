Place your source logo file here, named:

- boteco-logo.jpeg (preferred high-resolution, square or large rectangular)

Tips:
- A transparent PNG or SVG yields better adaptive icons. If you have one, place it as `boteco-logo.png` or `boteco-logo.svg` and update the generator script options accordingly.
- Keep visual margins around the artwork; the generator will center the logo and add safe-area padding.
